# N_Calendar
Adds an in-game calendar to the game, similar to the calendar in Persona 3, 4, and 5.

Use this plugin if:
- You want to track days in game separately from time in real life.
- You want to **simulate** a real Gregorian calendar inside your game.
- You want the game to know what date it is **in game**.

Do **NOT** use this plugin if:
- You want to run special events on **real** days, e.g. to congratulate the player on their birthday or to prank them on April Fools day.
- You need any calendar other than the Gregorian one. This plugin does not support the Julian or Lunar calendar, nor does it support custom ones.
- You need to dynamically add events to the calendar. Any event (e.g. New Year's) must be specified at the plugin level and cannot be altered once the game is running.
